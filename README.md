# Gimme Moustache




to-do:
- load image at start...
- delete pics
- download pics

- consider not drawing boxes or lines on mouseout? idunno... what ramifications will that have?
- get images of people via API... ideas:
  BEST BET:
  - Maybe Google has something to help get some images back just by searching for stuff?
    - https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview

  - API with pictures from old magazines?
  - API with wikipedia images?
  - API with old newspaper images?

      - https://www.instagram.com/developer/
        - just grab images from NBC or BBC or w/e
  - API with an identity generator?

  - API with placeholder images? (I guess only some of them will have humans...) :S

    - https://picsum.photos/
  - what does this API even do? (didn't want to read OR keep the tab open)
    - https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/images-api/
- what would happen if I shipped all this code over to react?
  - things would get messier, right? maybe let's do this a bit more carefully...
