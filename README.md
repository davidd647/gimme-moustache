# Gimme Moustache

## What is this?
  This is Gimme Moustache - a fun web app designed to help you waste away time in a fun way by drawing moustaches on people. If you'd like to preview it, here it is: https://pedantic-mccarthy-7d3922.netlify.app/

  Also, the name sounds like a command to kiss, which I guess is funny!

## How do I run it on my machine?
  - Download the repo
  - In command line, go to the same directory
  - Type "npm install", and let the scripts run
  - Type "npm start", and let the scripts run
  - Open a browser to localhost:1234

## To-do:
- make saved images downloadable
- be able to delete images off of the thing
- is it even possible to go mobile friendly? might have to wait and see what the competition manages to do...
